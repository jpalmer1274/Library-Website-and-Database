# Library-Website-and-Database


Project created for CPSC 321
Gonzaga University
Fall 2020

Created By JR Palmer and Aidan Lewis

This project revolves around the idea of creating a database and a simple front end website that could be used for a library. Users have the ability to view books,
request new books to be added, reserve study/meeting rooms, and rate books. Admins/librarians have the ability to add/remove books, remove requests, and do 
everything a regular user can do. 

This project was done by using php and html for the front end and SQL for the back end.

NOTE: This link/project may become obsolete upon the creators graduation (May 2021) as it is run using services provided by Gonzaga University.
